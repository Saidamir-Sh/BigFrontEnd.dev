import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

const resource = (() => {
  let data = null
  let status = 'pending'
  let fetcher = null
  return {
    get() {
      if (status === 'ready') {
        return data
      }
      if (status === 'pending') {
        fetcher = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            data = 1
            status = 'ready'
            resolve()
          }, 100)

function A() {
  console.log(1)
  const memoed = useMemo(() => {
    console.log(2)
    return 'memo'

  const data = resource.get()
  console.log(3)
  return memoed + data

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App/>)

// The App component is mounted and renders the A component within a Suspense component.

// The A component starts rendering and logs 1 to the console.

// The useMemo hook is called, and it logs 2 to the console.

// The resource.get() function is called, which enters the pending state and then throws a fetcher promise because the status is still 'pending'.

// The rendering of the A component is suspended due to the Suspense component. After 100ms, the fetcher promise is resolved, sets the status to 'ready', and the data to 1.

// The A component resumes rendering and logs 1 to the console again because the entire component is re-rendered due to the resolved fetcher promise.

// The useMemo hook is called again, and it logs 2 to the console again.

// The data variable is now set to 1, so the A component can continue rendering and logs 3 to the console.

// The A component returns the concatenated result of the memoized value 'memo' and the value of data, which is 1.

// key point: Suspense component will be rendered when a child ran into async render and all children in Suspense will be re-rendered after async resolve
